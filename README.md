# bkinny4148.github.io

A static personal website created using Jekyll and Github Pages to showcase some of my work as a student/developer.

The site is constantly in development so if there is a feature that seems broken I am probably in the middle of working on a change.



## TODO
- parallax effect
  - parallax on scroll?
  - parallax relative to center of screen
- bug with landing section expanding on mobile to fill screen
